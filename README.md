#Задача: <br>
#Conference mixer<br>

We are planning a conference with 100 attendees. One of the intended goals is to let people get to meet and know each other. To facilitate<br> the process we will predefine seats at our breakfast and lunch tables. The idea is to design the seating charts in such a way that each<br> participant will be seated with as many others as possible during the course of the conference. <br>
So:<br>
* We have 100 participants<br>
* The conference runs for 5 days, with breakfast and lunch served, yielding us 10 seating sessions<br>
* There will be 10 tables seating 10 people each<br>
* We want to print out for each guest a list of 10 locations — the number of table he will seat at each for meal<br>
* Plus print out the report of how many different people each participant will meet<br>
* Estimate average success of your placing algorithm<br>
